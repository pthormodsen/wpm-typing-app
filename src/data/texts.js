    "Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and behavior. It promotes code reuse through inheritance and encapsulation.",
    "Functional programming emphasizes pure functions, immutability, and avoiding side effects. It helps create predictable and testable code that is easier to reason about.",
    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting text. It is commonly used in README files, documentation, and note-taking tools like Notion and Obsidian.",
    "Dark mode has become a popular feature in apps and websites. It reduces eye strain in low-light environments and gives users more control over their visual experience.",
    "Animations and transitions can enhance the user experience when used thoughtfully. They provide visual feedback and make interfaces feel more responsive and engaging.",
    "Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) automate the process of testing and releasing software, ensuring that new changes are delivered quickly and reliably.",
    "Agile methodologies promote iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Teams work in short sprints to deliver incremental improvements and respond to changing requirements.",
    "Pair programming involves two developers working together at one workstation. One writes code while the other reviews each line, leading to higher quality and shared knowledge.",
    "Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality. They help catch bugs, improve readability, and ensure that best practices are followed throughout the codebase.",
    "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It improves code readability, maintainability, and performance.",
    "Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common software design problems. Examples include Singleton, Observer, Factory, and Strategy patterns.",
    "RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. They are stateless, scalable, and widely used for web services and mobile applications.",
    "GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data.",
    "Docker enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. Containers ensure consistency across different environments.",
    "Microservices architecture breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate over a network. This approach improves scalability and maintainability.",
    "Serverless computing allows developers to run code without managing servers. Cloud providers automatically handle infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance.",
    "Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) combine the best features of web and mobile apps. They work offline, load quickly, and can be installed on a user's device.",
    "Single Page Applications (SPAs) load a single HTML page and dynamically update content as the user interacts with the app, providing a seamless user experience.",
    "Versioning APIs is important to avoid breaking changes for existing clients. Use clear versioning strategies such as URI versioning or custom headers.",
    "Authentication and authorization are critical for securing applications. Use protocols like OAuth, JWT, and OpenID Connect to manage user access.",
    "Encryption protects sensitive data by converting it into unreadable text. Use HTTPS, TLS, and strong encryption algorithms to secure data in transit and at rest.",
